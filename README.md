# Lightning Browser (iOS, Android)

### A browser that brings deep lightning integration to the web

The goal is to allow the browser to interact with the Lightning Network programmatically. It focusses on the web-payments process and does not try to be a full node UI with advanced channel-management or similar features.

The browser implements the WebLN standard as the interface that allows websites to connect to Lightning Network nodes (to request payments, invoices, signatures, login, etc.) and enable seamless UX of web payments and authentications.
